# 🔥 FlareEnough

**FlareEnough** is an event-driven options DEX built on the [Flare Network](https://flare.xyz), allowing users to trade options based on real-world event outcomes—not just expiry dates. Whether it's an election, sports match, or economic decision, FlareEnough creates parallel option markets tied to each possible outcome. Traders choose the timeline they believe in, and only the timeline matching reality settles—others are discarded, with funds refunded.

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional options DEXs lock all participants into a single expiry timeline. **FlareEnough** introduces a novel approach by allowing users to trade **conditionally** on specific outcomes of real-world events. Each outcome has a corresponding "timeline"—a fully functional market for that hypothetical reality.

For example, during the US election:
- Timeline A: “Trump Wins”
- Timeline B: “Trump Loses”

Users trade options within their chosen timeline. Once the event concludes, **Flare’s oracle infrastructure** determines the actual outcome:
- Trades on the correct timeline settle normally using **FTSO**
- Trades on the incorrect timeline are canceled, and all premiums and collateral are returned

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Smart Contracts** (Solidity):
  - Handle option creation, trading, collateralization, and conditional settlement
  - Separate timelines per event outcome

- **Flare Oracle Integration**:
  - Uses **FDC (Flare Data Connector)** to fetch and store event data on-chain
  - Uses **FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle)** to securely settle options and validate outcome conditions

- **Frontend**:
  - Built with **React + Vite**
  - Enables intuitive timeline selection and trade execution
